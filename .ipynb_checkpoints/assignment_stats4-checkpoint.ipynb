Total Female 60 54 46 41 201 Male 40 44 53 57 194 Total 100 98 99 98 395 Question: Are gender and education level dependent at 5% level of significance? In other words, given the data collected above, is there a relationship between the gender of an individual and the level of education that they have obtained?Null Hypothesis H0 : Gender and education level are independent. Alternative Hypothesis H1 : Gender and education level are dependent."
